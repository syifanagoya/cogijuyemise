By this time, he was still a student at Harvard Law School. After completing U.S. Naval Justice School in 2005, he received orders to the Trial Service Office command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as JAG prosecutor. In 2006, DeSantis was promoted from lieutenant junior grade to lieutenant and worked for the commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo. He once worked directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility.</p><p>In 2007, he reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in California and was assigned to SEAL Team One. He was deployed to Iraq with the Troop Surge as the legal advisor to the SEAL Commander. In 2008, DeSantis returned to the United States, where he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service.</p><p>In 2012, DeSantis announced that he would run in the Republican primary for the 6th&nbsp;District, which won with 39% of the vote. He defeated Democratic candidate Heather Beaven by 57-43%, during the 2012 November general election. Being a lawmaker, on January 29, 2014, DeSantis introduced into the House the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014(H.R. 3973; 113th&nbsp;congress).</p><p>This bill would direct the United States Department of Justice to report to the United States Congress whenever any federal agency refrains from enforcing laws or regulations for any reason. However, the bill did not subsequently become law. Concerning law enforcement, DeSantis has been at the forefront in bringing agendas and bills into the House. Ron DeSantis was one of the founders of the Freedom Caucus, a group of congressional conservatives and libertarians.</p><p>On May 6, 2015, DeSantis announced that he was running for the United States Senate seat, held by Marco Rubio, but later withdrew and campaigned for re-election to the House after Rubio ended his presidential bid.</p><p>In January 2018, DeSantis announced his candidacy for governor of Florida to succeed term-limited Republican incumbent Rick Scott. On August 28, 2018, DeSantis won the Republican Primary, and in September the same year, he announced state representative, Jeanette Nunez, as his running mate. On September 10, 2018, he resigned his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to focus on his gubernatorial candidacy. &nbsp;He was announced the winner of the elections on November 17, 2018.</p><p>He became governor of Florida at the midnight of January 8, 2019, and was officially sworn in into office at noon the same day. After three days in office, DeSantis retrospectively pardoned the Groveland four, four black men falsely convicted of rape in 1949. On August 28, 2019, DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 26 counties in Hurricane Dorian’s expected path, which later expanded to the entire State on August 29. In March 2020, DeSantis decided against declaring a state of emergency in Florida during the Corona Virus pandemic.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>While serving at the military, DeSantis was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Ron DeSantis in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ron-DeSantis-Net-Worth.jpg><p>From being in the military to politics, DeSantis has been able to build himself up to the level he is currently.
