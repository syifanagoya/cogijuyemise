However, any speculations of a romantic relationship between the two are false.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lisa-Marie-Presley-Had-Close-Relationship-With-John-Travolta.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lisa Marie Presley.

Having been a member since 1975, he extended an invitation for her to explore the teachings and practices of Scientology for herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Priscilla, finding the experience to be spiritually welcoming, decided to join the Church in 1977. Consequently, Lisa became affiliated with the institution as well.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lisa Marie Presley supported John Travolta after the death of his son Jett</h2><p>In the aftermath of the heartbreaking loss of Travolta’s son, Jett, Lisa stepped forward as a staunch supporter for her devastated friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Jett, the eldest child of Travolta and Preston, had been afflicted by seizures from a young age and was later diagnosed with Kawasaki syndrome and autism.&nbsp;</p><p>During a family trip to the Bahamas, Jett suffered a severe seizure while bathing, resulting in a devastating fall that claimed his life in 2009.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-99.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">John Travolta and his late wife Kelly Preston.

He chose not to proceed with a new trial after a mistrial was declared as a result of a politician claiming to know the verdict before it was reached.</p><p>During the trial, it was clear what information the ambulance driver planned to disclose to the media, leading others to wonder if medical care was allowed in Scientology.</p><p>As a result, Travolta and Preston soon found themselves raising a child as members of a cult that forbade the use of modern medicine to treat Jett in the Bahamas.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Lisa, witnessing the onslaught of misinformation and the toll it took on her friends, felt compelled to speak out and set the record straight regarding Scientology’s beliefs regarding modern medicine.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking to her MySpace blog, Presley referred to Travolta and Preston as “the sweetest people in the world” and expressed her deep empathy for the pain they were enduring.</p><p>Presley’s statement aimed to dispel the misconceptions surrounding Scientology, asserting that religion does not discourage medical care, medicine, or the involvement of medical professionals, regardless of the circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>She said, “Whatever medical and or physical condition Jett had, I can tell you first hand that his parents were on a tireless, never-ending quest to get and provide him with the absolute best care anyone could ever ask for.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Travolta paid tribute to his late friend Lisa Marie Presley</h2><p>In the wake of the tragic passing of Lisa, Travolta, a longtime friend of the late star, paid a heartfelt tribute.&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa’s sudden demise on January 12, 2023, following a cardiac arrest, left her loved ones devastated.

The two quickly became close and developed a romantic connection, leading to a decade-long relationship.</p><p>Later, the couple eventually tied the knot in 2011 in a low-key ceremony at Bar Lurcat in Minneapolis, Stephanie’s home state. They also deliberately chose a single venue for both the ceremony and reception to simplify things for out-of-town guests.</p><p>During the wedding, the actor set only two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rules</a> for the celebration. The first rule was that everyone had to have fun, and the second was that Lance couldn’t see his wife’s wedding dress before she walked down the aisle.</p><p>Similarly, Stephanie embraced simplicity in her wedding preparations, allocating a modest $250 for her dress, which the actor personally picked up from the post office. She also chose floral arrangements for the dress details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-100.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lance Reddick and his wife, Stephanie Reddick, were together for over two decades.

She suggested peonies because they were in season. I didn’t even know the flower color until the wedding day, and they turned out beautifully.”</p><p>Additionally, she fondly recalled her favorite moment as the day her mom saw her in the dress and moved to tears.</p><p>Although the couple openly shared details about their love story and wedding, they intentionally chose to keep the rest of their married life more private, valuing a sense of intimacy and personal space.</p><p>However, the actor and his wife made several red-carpet appearances together over the years, attending events such as premieres for movies like White House Down, The Blacklist, and Godzilla vs Kong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>https://t.co/udSaRa6iKL</a> Lance Reddick's wife Stephanie Reddick pays tribute to late actor <a href=#>https://t.co/eqbLpMmEA0</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/crANvc7Nzv</a></p>— Film-News.co.uk (@FilmNewsWeb) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 19, 2023</a></figure><p>Now, following Lance’s untimely passing due to heart disease, his wife took a moment to connect with her late husband’s fans and express profound gratitude.

Later, on November 3, 2011, she passed away, marking a deeply sorrowful chapter in their lives.</p><p>After Suzanne’s passing, Lance candidly discussed the profound loss of his first wife and the mother of his two children in an interview with Strombo in 2012.</p><p>Reflecting on the impact of the tragedy, the actor emphasized, “It made me realize that I always have to keep in front of me why I’m doing this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lance-Reddick-Wife.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lance Reddick with one of his two children (Photo: Facebook)</p><p>Sharing the emotional weight of becoming his kids’ sole parent, he stated, “I felt it more with my ex-wife because suddenly I was my kids’ only parent… I have great kids, and it’s because they had a great mom.”</p><p>After his first wife’s passing, Lance and his second wife, Stephanie, continued to care for and raise his children, providing them with love and support.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Melissa Fumero Had Crush on Husband David Fumero Long before Wedding — Their Married Life</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Melissa Fumero and David Fumero have been together for more than a decade.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Melissa-Fumero-Wedding.jpg alt="Melissa Fumero Had Crush on Husband David Fumero Long before Wedding — Their Married Life" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>American actress Melissa Fumero had a crush on her now-husband, David Fumero, ever since her teenage years, and little did she know at the time that one day, he would become her spouse.</p><p>When Melissa had a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">crush</a> on David, he was a young model who even made a brief cameo in Mariah Carey’s 1997 hit single ‘Honey.’ However, when the actress finally met David on the set of One Life to Live, she didn’t recognize him.</p><p>At that time, Melissa played the role of Adriana Cramer, while her now-beau appeared as Cristian Vega on the show.
