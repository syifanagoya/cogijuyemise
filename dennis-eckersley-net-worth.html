All of his efforts helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Dennis Eckersley? As of mid-2017, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $20 million, mostly earned through a successful career in professional baseball. He achieved a lot of his fame as a closer, and became the first of only two pitchers in MLB history to earn 50 saves and 20 wins in a season, but ll of his achievements ensured the position of his wealth.</p><h3>Dennis Eckersley Net Worth $20 million</h3><p>Dennis grew up watching baseball, and was a fan of both the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics. He developed his pitching skills, but would also play football while attending Washington High School, but had to stop in order to protect his throwing arm. He played as a pitcher for Washington, and won 29 games with a 90 miles per hour fastball.</p><p>Dennis joined the 1972 MLB Draft and was selected by the Cleveland Indians during the third round. He made his MLB debut in 1975, and would become the American League Rookie Pitcher of the Year with a 13-7 win-loss record. He started earning popularity with his first All-Star selection three years later, with a 14-13 win-loss record. He was then traded to the Boston Red Sox, and would win a career high 20 games in 1978. However, later in his career with Boston he started pitching poorly, and it led him being traded to the Chicago Cubs. Despite that, his net worth continued to build, especially as he helped the Cubs get to their first postseason appearance since 1945. He stayed with the Cubs until 1986, but was then sent to rehabilitation due to alcoholism, which started to effect his performance.</p><p>In 1987 he was traded to Oakland Athletics, and was then moved as a closer after an injury to Jay Howell. He flourished in the role, and would become dominant, earning 45 saves in 1988. The Athletics would win the 1989 World Series, and he would earn the save of the final game of the Series. He continued being a dominant closer in the next few years, and became the Cy Young Award winner and American League’s Most Valuable Player in 1992, with 51 saves during the season. His net worth continued to flourish thanks to his performances.</p><p>In 1994 he became a free agent; during his final playing years, he became part of the St. Louis Cardinals, and then the Boston Red Sox for one final season. He eventually completed more games than any other pitcher in MLB history, at 1,071. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2004.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Eckersley was married to Denise (21973-78) who left him for Rick Manning; the affair led to his trade to the Red Sox. After two years, he married model Nancy O’Neil but they divorced in 2004 after his retirement from baseball. He is now married to former lobbyist Jennifer.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.417748917749><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Dennis Eckersley</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 3, 1954</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Oakland, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 2" (1.88 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>86&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Washington High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Jennifer Eckersley (m. 2005), Nancy O'Brien (m. 1980–2004), Denise Manning (m. 1973–1978)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Allie Eckersley, Mandee Eckersley, Jake Eckersley</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Bernice Eckersley, Wallace Eckersley</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Cindy Eckersley, Wallace Eckersley</td></tr><tr readability=0.4375><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/eck43</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0248594/</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Awards</td><td>American League Most Valuable Player Award, American League Cy Young Award, Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>Major League Baseball on TBS</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>His long hair throughout his major league career</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=33.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Gave up one of the most famous home runs in baseball history, Kirk Gibson's pinch hit blast in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Named to Baseball Digest magazine's 1975 Rookie All-Star Team.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>Inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, 2004.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Made major league debut on 12 April 1975.</td></tr><tr readability=20><td>5</td><td>Notable career statistics: 10.45 Walks and Hits per 9 innings pitched (72nd All Time), 2.02 Walks per 9 innings pitched (91st All Time), 6.58 Strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (99th All Time), 1,071 Games (2nd All Time), 390 Saves (3rd All Time), 3,285.7 Innings Pitched (86th All Time), 2,401 Strikeouts (33rd All Time), 347 Home Runs Allowed (17th All Time), 171 Losses (85th All Time), 1,278 Earned Runs Allowed (78th All Time), 13,534 Batters Faced (79th All Time) and 577 Games Finished (12th All Time).</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>6</td><td>Finished in top 10 in voting for American League Cy Young Award in 1978-1979 and 1988-1990.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>7</td><td>Finished 5th in voting for 1988 and 1989 American League MVP.
