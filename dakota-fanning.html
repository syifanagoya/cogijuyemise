She even made history by being the youngest SAG nominee, thanks to her role in the 2001 movie I Am Sam.</p><p>Dakota Fanning reached adolescence in the late 2000s, getting more mature roles in multiple movies, such as The Secret Life of Bees and The Twilight Saga. Besides her mature roles, Dakota Fanning is also in for dating games, having a lengthy portfolio of boyfriends throughout the years!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Are Dakota Fanning and Henry Frye Still Together?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Dakota-Fanning-with-her-latest-boyfriend-Henry-Frye.jpg><p>Dakota Fanning and her latest boyfriend, <strong>Henry Frye</strong>, were first romantically linked in 2017 after one of her friends posted (now deleted) two Polaroid pictures of Dakota and Henry licking each other’s faces, complete with the caption, “lovers.”</p><p>Shortly after their relationship bomb was dropped, the pair were seen strolling around New York, albeit they still seemed awkward and weren’t touchy enough! Dakota and Henry quickly became a staple in various red-carpet events. After making their red carpet debut in the 2018 Prada event, the smitten couple often attended shows together.</p><p class=related-post>Also Read: <a href=#>Who is Elle Fanning Boyfriend in 2023? Her Dating History</a></p><p>Despite not coming from the same background, Henry was highly supportive of his lady, visiting Dakota in Dublin when she was filming for the 2019 movie Sweetness in the Belly. Unfortunately, it was the last time the couple was spotted together, considering Dakota no longer posts pictures of Henry on her Instagram, and the paps keep failing to capture them together.</p><p>Furthermore, during the COVID-19 quarantine in 2020, Dakota made it clear that she quarantined with her family only, without any glimpse, which might indicate Henry was part of the crew.</p><p>It seems safe to claim that Dakota is officially back on the market, guys!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Dakota Fanning’s Rekindled Romance with Her High School Beau</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Dakota-Fanning-and-Logan-Markley.jpg><p>Shortly after her much-debated romance with model Jamie Strachan ended in 2016, Dakota Fanning didn’t waste time to move on! This time, it was with her ex-boyfriend from high school, <strong>Logan Markley</strong>.</p><p>The rekindled old flame was spotted holding hands while strolling around the busy streets of New York with smiles on their faces. Dakota and Logan reportedly dated for a year while studying at North Hollywood’s Campbell Hall Episcopal High School.</p><p>A source also <a href=# rel=noopener>claimed</a> that Dakota and Logan “have always been close” despite their failed romance in high school. Unfortunately, their second try at love didn’t succeed either, as they (once again) broke up in early 2017.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why Did Dakota Fanning and Jamie Strachan Break Up?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Dakota-Fanning-ex-boyfriend-Jamie-Strachan.jpg><p>Dakota Fanning might be the least problematic former child star in Hollywood, but one of her past relationships caused quite a backlash. Yep, in 2014, just shortly after she turned 20, Dakota started dating English model <strong>Jamie Strachan</strong>. This romance raised several eyebrows, considering that Dakota was barely legal and Jami was 13 years older than her!</p><p>However, Dakota ignored the negative comments and put forward her happiness above all, claiming that “it’s really fun to have someone to experience things with.”</p><p>“People love who they love, and you go with that,” the actress told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Times</a>. “I’m super happy,” she added, claiming that being with Jamie “feels right.”</p><p>However, their romance didn’t last long, as the couple broke up in 2016 after around four years of dating. In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Town & Country</a>, Dakota candidly addressed the reason for their separation: Jamie talked bad behind her back!</p><p class=related-post>See Also: <a href=#>Who Is Robert Pattinson Girlfriend? List of Girls He’s Actually Dated</a></p><p>“I was raised by very traditional Southern parents with Southern manners,” Dakota began. “You don’t air your dirty laundry to people that aren’t your family or your friends,” she continued.</p><p>Oh, come on, Jamie, it’s a universal manner to not talk bad about your partner!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Did Dakota Fanning and Freddie Highmore Date?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Dakota-Fanning-and-Freddie-Highmore.jpg><p>Being the most prominent child actors during their prime years, it’s unsurprising that <strong>Dakota Fanning and Freddie Highmore </strong>formed a tight friendship between them. They were even once involved in a brief dating rumor back in 2009 after they were reportedly having dinner together as teenagers!</p><p>“People have often asked me about you,” Freddie told Dakota on an episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety’s Actors on Actors</a>. “Like, what was it like to date Dakota,” he continued, to which Dakota reacted with a full-bellied laugh.</p><p>Freddie also addressed that the picture of them dining together (the one that sparked the romance rumors) was a dinner to discuss the movie they “never ended up doing together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibopqytbuNnKamZ5SWuLDAwGadmqaenruoew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jaime-king-debuts-skinny-post-baby-bikini-body-pictures-2014166.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jaime King Debuts Skinny Post-Baby Bikini Body: Pictures">&larr;
